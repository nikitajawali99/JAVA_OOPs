## Theory ##
Polymorphism in java means many forms and one type of action can be performed
in various ways.
We can't extends/inherit properties from final and private class

## Types of polymorphism ##

1)Compile-time polymorphism -

1)It is type of polymorphism in which call to an overloaded method is 
  resolved at compile-time rather than run-time.
2)It can be achieved using 1)Method hiding 2)Method overloading 3)Constructor overloading

2)Runtime polymorphism - 

1)It is type of polymorphism in which call to an overridden method is defined at run-time
rather than compile-time
2)It can be achieved using 1)Method overriding 2)Dynamic method dispatch

## Examples ##
1)Water at room temperature is liquid and at refrigerator it will be frozen and at boiling
  temperature it will be gas
  
2)A person at office is an employee, at home is a father/husband and at store he will be
 customer
 
 ## Advantages ##
 
 1)Code resubility 2)Flexibility 3)Efficient code
