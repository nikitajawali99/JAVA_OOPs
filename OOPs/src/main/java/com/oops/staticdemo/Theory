## Definition ##

Static variables in java belongs to class rather than object of the variable.

## Rules ##
1)Only one copy per class.
2)Memory management is done.
3)Belongs to class rather than object of the variable.
4)It is used to share common properties/behaviour of the variable.
5)Use of this and super is not allowed.
6)They stored in the heap memory and get's bound in compile-time.
7)No need to create object we can directly use using class name.
8)Get's memory at the time of class loading ie at the time of .dot class even
  before the main method.
9)Inside static method we can't use non-static method but vice versa is not true.
10)We can declare static class provided top class is the normal class and it is called
  nested classes.
  
 ## Static block ##
 1)It is a special block and it is used for initialization of static data member.
 2)Get's memory at the time of class loading even before the main class.
 3)It is used to write logic/manipulation that needs to be done first.
 4)We can have multiple staic block but execution will be from top to bottom. 
 
 eg static{
 }
 
 ## Ways to use static ##
 
 1)Using static block
 eg static{
 }
 2)Using static method 
  eg public static void m1(){
  }
 3)Using static variable
 eg public static int pie; 
 
 ## Notes ##
 1)Static constructor are permit because constructors are used to initialize an objects
  and if a constructor is static an object of subclass can't be accessed.
 2)Static methods can't be overridden because they are not dispatched at runtime time
 but they are bound at compile-time.
 3)Static methods can be overloaded as long as parameters are different.
 4)When we declare a static method in java the JVM first executes the static methods
 and then it creates the object of the class, Since the instance objects are not available
 at the time of class loading hence non-static methods can't be used inside static methods.
 
 ## Types of blocks ## 
 1)Local block - A block which is created inside constructors and methods.
 
 2)Instance block - 1)A block which is created for initialization, writing common logic 
 that you want to execute.2)It will execute after static block but before main class.
 3)We can have multiple instance block.
 syntax - > {}
 
 3)Static block- 1)Used for initialization. 2)Get's executed first in the class before
 main class.3)We can have multiple instance block.
  syntax - > static{ 
  }
  
  ## Order of execution ##
  1)Static block <- Static method <- Instance block <- Constructor <- Non-static method
  
  ## Real-life examples ##
  1)In a school, static variables are school name,location,phone no,address
    and non-static variables are student rollNo,div,class teacher,student name
