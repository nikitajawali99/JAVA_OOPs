## Definition and terms ##

1)Hiding the complexities and showing only necessary functionalities. 
2)Abstraction is achieved by making class and method abstract.
3)It only shows services that are offered but not implementation part.
4)It is an non-access modifier and it's hiding is (0-100)%.

## Rules ##

1)If method is abstract then class needs to be abstract but vice versa is not true.
2)If a regular class extends abstract class then it has to implement the abstract class methods.
3)An abstract class can be blank.
4)A regular class can't extend more than one abstract class.
5)Private and final methods can't be abstract class and methods.
6)We can have constructors and static methods inside abstract class.
7)We can't create object directly but we can create using subclass.
8)Inside abstract class we can have concrete and final methods. 

## Examples ##

1)Working of a mobile phone we need to send SMS from your mobile you only type text
and send the message, you don't know the internal working/processing about the service.
2)ATM machine is used for cash withdrawn money transfer, adding money in our daily
life.But we don't know internally what things are happening inside ATM machine when we
insert ATM card for performing any kind of operation

## Use of constructors ##

1)We can't create an object of abstract class but we can create using subclass of 
abstract class. When we create an object of subclass of an abstract class it calls the
constructor of subclass in the 1st statement and if abstract class doesn't have
constructor then it will not get compiled
