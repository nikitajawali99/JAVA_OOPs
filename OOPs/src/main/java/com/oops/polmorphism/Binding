Static binding ->1) When a type of object is determined at compile-time is called
                  static binding.
                  2)Early binding and performance is better
                  3)If there is any private,final or static method in a class are statically
                  bound because compiler does not have difficulty to determine object
                  of the class.
                  
 Dynamic binding ->1) When a type of object is determined at run-time is called
                      dynamic binding.
                   2)Late binding and performance is low
