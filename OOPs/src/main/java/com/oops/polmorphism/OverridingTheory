## Method overriding ##

1)When a method of superclass is overriden in subclass providing more
specific implementation is called method overriding.
2)Method overriding supports at run-time polymorphism.

## Rules ##

1)Sub-class method access should be same or more than superclass method access modifier.
2)It must be a IS-A relationship.
3)Private and Final methods can't be overridden.
4)Method name and parameters should be same.
5)Return type must be same or covariant is also allowed.
6)Static methods can't be overriden.
7)Exception rules :
1)If the superclass method doesn't throw an exception then child class method can only 
throw unchecked exceptions.
2)If the superclass method is throwing an exception then child class method can only
throw same or sub-class but can't throw a parent exceptions.
3)If the superclass method is not throwing an exception then child class may or may not
throw an exception.

## Advantages ##

1)Code reusability.
2)Change of existing behaviour of a method.
3)To change the functionality.
