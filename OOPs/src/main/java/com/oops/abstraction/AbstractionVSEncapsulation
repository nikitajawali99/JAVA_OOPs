Abstraction                             vs            Encapsulation

1)In abstraction problems are solved        1)In encapsulation problems are solved
  at design level.                            at implementation part.
2)Objects can't be created.                 2)Objects can be created.
3)Abstraction is done by making             3)Encapsulation is done by making variables
  class and method abstract.                   private and accessing using getter and setter
4)In abstraction, detail hiding is          4)In encapsulation, data hiding is done.
  done.
5)Abstraction is done for reducing          5)Encapsulation is done for data protection and
  code complexities.                          security.
6)Outer layout is used for design.          6)Inner layout is used for design.
