## Theory ##

1)In a class we have different methods with same method name but different
  signature is called method overloading.
2)Either one or more parameters should be different.
3)If method name is same, parameters are different but return type is different
 then it will not consider as method overloading.
4)In method overloading, compiler decides which method to call according to the
 matching signature
5)Private,final and main method can be overloaded
6)It is used when we want to have same method name and doing the same thing but
  with more parameters.
  
## Advantages ##
1)Code resubility
2)More readability and understand
